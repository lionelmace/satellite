## Deploying an app that uses {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}}
{: #sat-storage-vpc-deploy-app}


You can use the `ibm-vpc-block-csi-driver` to create PVCs that you can use in your cluster workloads.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create a PVC that references a VPC storage class that you created earlier.

    ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
        metadata:
        name: my-pvc
        spec:
        storageClassName: ibmc-vpc-block-5iops-tier
        accessModes:
            - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
            requests:
            storage: 10Gi

    ```
    {: codeblock}
        
1. Create the PVC in your cluster. 

    ```sh
    oc apply -f pvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Create a YAML configuration file for a pod that mounts the PVC that you created. 

    ```yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
            name: my-deployment
            labels:
            app: my-app
        spec:
        replicas: 1
        selector:
            matchLabels:
            app: my-app
        template:
            metadata:
            labels:
                app: my-app
            spec:
            containers:
            - image: ngnix # Your containerized app image.
                name: my-container
                volumeMounts:
                - name: my-volume
                mountPath: /mount-path
            volumes:
            - name: my-volume
                persistentVolumeClaim:
                claimName: my-pvc

    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Create the pod in your cluster.

    ```sh
    oc apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Verify that the pod is deployed. Note that it might take a few minutes for your app to get into a `Running` state.

    ```sh
    oc get pods
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    ```sh
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    my-deployment                       1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Verify that the app can write to your block storage volume by logging in to your pod.

    ```sh
    oc exec my-deployment
    ```
    {: pre}

1. View the contents of the `outfile` file to confirm that your app can write data to your persistent storage.

    ```sh
    cat /
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    
    ```sh
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    Fri Jul 16 07:49:39 EDT 2021
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Exit the pod.

    ```sh
    exit
    ```
    {: pre}



## Removing {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} storage from your apps

        {: pre}

1. Delete the PVC.

    ```sh
    oc delete pvc <pvc_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Verify that your PV is automatically removed.

    ```sh
    oc get pv
    ```
    {: pre}

## Removing the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} storage configuration from your cluster
{: #vpc-csi-template-rm}

If you no longer plan on using your {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} in your cluster, you can use the CLI unassign your cluster from the storage configuration.
{: shortdesc}

Note that if you remove the storage configuration, the driver is then uninstalled from all assigned clusters. Your PVCs, PVs, and data are not removed. However, you might not be able to access your data until you re-install the driver in your cluster again.
{: important}

### Removing the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} storage configuration using the console
{: #vpc-csi-rm-ui}
{: ui}

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} storage dashboard, select the storage configuration you want to delete.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment ls (--cluster CLUSTER | --config CONFIG | --location LOCATION | --service-cluster-id CLUSTER)
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Remove the assignment. After the assignment is removed, the driver pods and storage classes are removed from all clusters that were part of the storage assignment.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud sat storage assignment rm --assignment <assignment_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Verify that the driver is removed from your cluster.

    1. List of the storage classes in your cluster and verify that the storage classes are removed.
    
        ```sh
        oc get sc
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. List the pods in the `kube-system` namespace and verify that the storage driver pods are removed.
    
        ```sh
        oc get pods -n kube-system | grep vpc
        ```
        {: pre}

4. Optional: Remove the storage configuration.
